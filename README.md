# Wireless-Communication-Fundamentals
This repository is devoted to studying the fundamentals of wireless communication from David Tse and Pramod Viswanath's popular and resourceful book---Fundamentals of Wireless Communication!
To validate understanding of the subject matter and to acquire coding skills, some vital communication concepts are simulated and practice code shared.

### 1. The Wireless Channel
- KEYWORDS: Additive White Gaussian Noise, baseband signal model, fading scales, Rayleigh fading channel, Rician fadin channel
